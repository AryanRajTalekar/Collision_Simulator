# Collision Simulator

This project is a simple **collision simulator** built using Java, where two rectangular objects collide with each other and keep on colliding in a simulated environment. The objects move across the screen and interact based on their masses and velocities. After each collision, the objects update their velocities according to the principles of elastic collisions.

### Key Features:
- Two rectangular objects with user-defined masses.
- Velocities of the objects are fixed (not user-inputted in this version).
- The objects collide elastically, and their velocities change after each collision.
- The size of the objects is dynamically based on their mass (larger mass = larger object).
- The velocity of the objects is displayed on the screen in pixels/frame.
- Simple physics-based movement and collision logic.

### Technologies Used:
- **Java** for the development of the simulator.
- **Swing** for the graphical user interface (GUI).

### How to Run:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/collision-simulator.git
